# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

A collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in **C++** and **C**. This repository serves as a personal archive for learning, practice, and reference.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized by topic into separate directories:

### 🔗 Linked Lists (`/LINKED_LIST`)
Implementation of various types of linked lists and related problems.
* **Singly Linked List:** Creation, insertion, deletion, and reversal.
* **Doubly Linked List:** Implementations in C and C++.
* **Projects:** Snake Game using Linked Lists.
* **Key Files:** `linkedlist_REAL.cpp`, `polynomial.cpp`, `snake.cpp`

### 🌲 Trees (`/TREES`)
Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), and traversal algorithms.
* **Core Concepts:** Inorder, Preorder, Postorder traversals, and BFS.
* **BST Operations:** Insertion, deletion, search, and validation.
* **Documentation:** `tree.md` contains detailed notes on tree properties and formulas.

### 📚 Stack (`/STACK`)
LIFO data structure implementations and standard problems.
* **Implementations:** Array-based stacks.
* **Applications:** Infix to Postfix conversion, String Palindrome check, Prime Factors.

### 🚶 Queue (`/QUEUE`)
FIFO data structure implementations.
* **Variants:** Circular Queue, Double Ended Queue (Deque), Priority Queue.
* **Implementations:** Array-based and Linked List-based queues.

### 🧱 Heap (`/HEAP`)
Heap data structure implementation (Array-based).

## 🚀 How to Run

You will need a C/C++ compiler (like GCC) installed on your system.

**Using Terminal / Command Prompt:**
1.  Navigate to the directory of the file you want to run:
    ```bash
    cd LINKED_LIST
    ```
2.  Compile the source file:
    ```bash
    g++ linkedlist_REAL.cpp -o output
    ```
3.  Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./output    # On Mac/Linux
    output.exe  # On Windows
    ```

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Language:** C, C++
* **Editor:** VS Code
